# React + TypeScript interview

You are given a launch function which randomly resolves with a payload or rejects with an Error. Build the UI to display the various state of the `launch` function on click of the button.

Hint - create a custom hook to handle async callback

Bonus:

Make component launch on first load
Launch repeatedly every `x` seconds
Stop launch it on demand.
