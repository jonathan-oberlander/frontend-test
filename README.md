# React + TypeScript interview

You are given a launch function which randomly resolves with a payload or rejects with an Error. Build the UI to display the various state of the `launch` function on the click of a button. Hint, create a generic custom hook that handles async callbacks.

Bonus points:

- Make component launch on first load.
- Launch repeatedly every `x` seconds.
- Stop launch on demand.
