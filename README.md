# React + TypeScript interview

You are given a `launch` function which randomly `resolves with a payload` or `rejects with an Error`. 

- Build a UI to display the various state of the `launch` function on the click of a button.

Hint, create a generic custom hook that handles async callbacks.

- Launch repeatedly every `x` seconds.
- Stop launch on demand.
